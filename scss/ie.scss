Stylesheet: IE Stylesheet

So instead of using the respond.js file to add media query support
to IE, we're going to use SASS to create an easily readable css file.
Here, we import all the styles the standard stylesheet gets, only
without the media queries. No need to worry about editing anything!

******************************************************************/

//note, this is currently called in addition to the regular styles in IE (most of which it obv doesn't understand). Modernizr stuff is called as part of regular styles.
//there's probably a way of slimming down the amount of CSS IE ends up with - but it's quite probably not really worth doing.

/*
Remember, all the BASE styles are called already since IE can
read those. Below, we need to import only the stuff IE can't 
understand (what's inside the media queries). We also need to
import the mixins file so SASS can understand the variables.
*/

/* import mixins */
@import "mixins";

@import "480up";					//uncomment these (or add to them) depending on the situation
@import "768up";
@import "1024up";

/* 
you can call the larger styles if you want, but there's really no need 
*/

ADDITIONAL IE FIXES
These fixes are now ONLY seen by IE, so you don't have to worry
about using prefixes, although it's best practice. For more info
